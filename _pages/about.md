Hi, I am Liangbing Zhao. You can also call me Liam. I am currently a MS/PhD student at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), under the guidance of my advisor, Prof. [Mohamed Elhoseiny](https://www.mohamed-elhoseiny.com/). During my undergraduate years, I was supervised by Prof. [Si Liu](https://colalab.net/). I was also a research intern at Meitu Inc., where I worked on video diffusion models with Dr. [Xuecheng Nie](https://niexc.github.io/).


Research Interests
======

- **Generative Models**: Advancing and applying generative models, such as diffusion models, flow matching, and autoregressive models, with a focus on improving their architectures and exploring innovative applications.
- **Unified Models**: Developing models that integrate generative and understanding tasks, with an emphasis on leveraging understanding capabilities to enhance generative performance.
