Hi, I am **Liangbing Zhao**. You can also call me Liam. I am currently a **first-year PhD student** at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST), where I also earned my Master's degree. I am privileged to be advised by Prof. [Mohamed Elhoseiny](https://www.mohamed-elhoseiny.com/).

Previously, I completed my undergraduate studies under the supervision of Prof. [Si Liu](https://colalab.net/). I also spent time as a research intern at Meitu Inc. with Dr. [Xuecheng Nie](https://niexc.github.io/).


Research Interests
======

- **Generative Models**: Advancing and applying generative models, such as diffusion models, flow matching, and autoregressive models, with a focus on improving their architectures and exploring innovative applications.
- **Unified Models**: Developing models that bridge generative and understanding tasks, with an emphasis on leveraging understanding capabilities to enhance generative performance.
