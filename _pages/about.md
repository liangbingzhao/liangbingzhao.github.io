Hi, I am Liangbing Zhao. You can also call me Liam. I am currently a BSc student at Beihang Univerisity, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. I am currently working with Prof. [Mohamed Elhoseiny](https://www.mohamed-elhoseiny.com/) at [KAUST](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/). During my undergraduate years at BUAA, I was supervised by Prof. [Si Liu](https://colalab.net/). I was also a research intern at Meitu Inc., where I worked on video diffusion models with Dr. [Xuecheng Nie](https://niexc.github.io/).

I am currently looking for a PhD position starting from Fall 2024! Please feel free to contact me if you are interested.

Research Interests
======
My research interests lie primarily in **developing more efficient, robust, and adaptable deep learning algorithms to conquer generation problems.**
- Design the next generation of generative models based on DDPM, GAN, etc.
- Devise algorithms for 2D/3D synthesis and solve 2D/3D generation editing problems.
