    - title: ToddlerDiffusion: Flash Interpretable Controllable Diffusion Model
      institution: KAUST
      year: 2023 - present
      description:
        - Introduced an inherently interpretable and controllable diffusion model that systematically generates a chain of interpretable stages, generating sketches, palettes, and finally RGB images.
        - Leveraged bridge architecture to reduce training and sampling steps to 10-20, but getting the same quality results as previous state-of-the-art methods.
        - Under review for CVPR2024.
