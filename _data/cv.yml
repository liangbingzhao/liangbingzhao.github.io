    - title: ToddlerDiffusion——Flash Interpretable Controllable Diffusion Model
      institution: KAUST
      year: 2023 - 2023
      description:
        - Introduced an inherently interpretable and controllable diffusion model that systematically generates a chain of interpretable stages, generating sketches, palettes, and finally RGB images.
        - Leveraged bridge architecture to reduce training and sampling steps to 10-20, but getting the same quality results as previous state-of-the-art methods.
        - Under review for CVPR2024.

    - title: Cross-Attention and Seamless Replacement of Latent Prompts for High-Definition Image-Driven Video Editing
      institution: Meitu Inc.
      year: 2022-2023
      description:
        - Introduced a novel image-driven video editing task to generate customized video from an input image.
        - Proposed a LIVE(Latent prompt-based Image-driven Video Editing)framework to deal with customized video editing task. Devised a training and inference pipeline specific to the video editing task maintaining cross-frame
consistency while ensuring that the new object is coherent with the sequence’s motion.
        - Accepted by Electronics.
